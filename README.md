# Music-Playlist
Welcome to the Linked List Playlist repository! This project explores the concept of linked lists in computer science through the lens of music. Each track in this playlist represents a node in a linked list, creating a seamless and harmonious musical journey.

Overview
A linked list is a fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, each containing a reference to the next element in the sequence. Similarly, this playlist is curated to transition smoothly from one track to the next, mimicking the interconnectedness and flexibility of linked lists.
The playlist is structured like a linked list, with each track representing a node. The order of the tracks is carefully curated to ensure a cohesive musical experience, much like the arrangement of elements in a linked list
